description: Installs the chart
tools: sys.workspace.read, sys.workspace.write, sys.exec?, sys.getenv, sys.chat.finish, sys.write
chat: true

Do the following sequentially, not in parallel

1. Read the workspace file chart.json to determine the current chart
2. Read the sample instructions from the workspace file instructions.txt
3. Read the workspace file values.yaml for install options. Prefer the values from this file over the ones in the instructions.
4. List the current helm repos. If the repo is already added do not add or update the repo.  You do not need to run 'helm update'
5. If there is not a suggested namespace to install the chart into, ask the user if they would like to use the default namespace or create a different one.
6. List all helm release in the cluster to see if this chart is already installed.
7. Use the instructions from step 2 as a guide, before executing an individual command prompt the user first. Use ${GPTSCRIPT_WORKSPACE_DIR}/values.yaml for the config.
8. Ensure that the helm chart installed successfully, if not try to troubleshoot why it failed
9. Read the helm notes from the install.
10. List all the associated resources to the install helm chart
11. If the user is happy, then finish the chat.

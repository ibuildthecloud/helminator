Do the following steps

1. Ask the which helm chart they liked to install. A name or description.
2. Search google to find an appropriate helm chart name matching the users description. Ask the user to confirm the helm chart name.
3. Once you know the name of the helm chart refer to https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?ts_query_web=%s to find the specific version and repo of the chart.
4. If multiple version are available pick a stable version over a beta, alpha, or release candidate.  Also prefer a chart that is official or from the upstream project unless ${description} says otherwise.
5. Ask the user to confirm the result
6. Write following json struction to chart.json in the workspace.

```json
{
    // Chart name
    "name": "$name"
    // The repo holding the chart, this must be a full URL that can be passed to "helm repo add"
    "repo": "$repo"
    // The version to install
    "version": "$version"
}
```

7. Finish the chat session. Do not ask to further assist, the session is complete.
